PS-mobile-export
================

Hi all,

We at Mobile Clipboard (www.mobileclipboard.com) were spending a lot of time exporting assets from PhotoShop to the various resolutions required for native iOS and Android mobile app builds. This can be partially automated by slicing but we were finding it hard to get a one-click export all solution.

We worked with Evgeny Trefilov (@evgenytr) to develop these scripts to export all layers or folders with the "@" symbol at the start of the layer or folder name. The script will ask for the base density of the PSD, the name of the folder to export to and then export the visual assets to a suitable folder structure.

We hope this script will help to speed up your app development times - it would be great to hear back from you on how it is working and, for those who can script, if you have any improvements. We would also be happy to talk with world-class designers who are looking to do UX/UI work to see if we can work with you on future client projects.

Best wishes,
Niall Ã“ Tuathail from Mobile Clipboard
